# Password-Manager

The provided code appears to be a JavaScript code snippet for a simple password manager web application. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality step by step:

1. `maskPassword` Function:
   - This function takes a password as input and returns a string with the same number of asterisks as the length of the password. The purpose is to mask the password when displaying it in the user interface.

2. `copyText` Function:
   - This function is responsible for copying text to the clipboard.
   - It takes a text input (`txt`) and uses the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` method to write the text to the clipboard.
   - If the operation is successful, it displays an alert with the message "Clipboard successfully set" and briefly shows an element with the id "alert" (presumably to indicate a successful copy operation) before hiding it after 2 seconds.
   - If the clipboard write operation fails, it displays an alert with the message "Clipboard copying failed."

3. `deletePassword` Function:
   - This function is called when the user wants to delete a password associated with a website.
   - It takes the website as input and performs the following steps:
     - Retrieves the stored passwords from local storage.
     - Filters out the password entry with a matching website using the `filter` method.
     - Updates the local storage with the filtered array of passwords, effectively deleting the password entry for the specified website.
     - Displays an alert to inform the user that the password has been successfully deleted.
     - Finally, it calls the `showPasswords` function to refresh the displayed passwords in the table.

4. `showPasswords` Function:
   - This function is responsible for populating a table with stored passwords and displaying it on the web page.
   - It first checks if there is any data in local storage. If there is no data or the data is empty, it displays "No Data To Show" in the table.
   - If there is data in local storage, it dynamically constructs an HTML table to display the passwords.
   - It retrieves the stored passwords from local storage, iterates through them, and creates table rows with columns for website, username, masked password (using the `maskPassword` function), and a delete button.
   - It also includes "Copy" buttons next to the website, username, and password fields, which allow the user to copy those values to the clipboard.
   - The `showPasswords` function updates the table's inner HTML with the generated rows.
   - After displaying the passwords, it clears the input fields for website, username, and password.

5. `Event Listeners and Form Submission` :
   - The code sets up an event listener for a button with the class "btn." This event listener triggers when the user clicks the button.
   - When the button is clicked, it prevents the default form submission behavior (page refresh).
   - It retrieves the input values for website, username, and password from the corresponding input fields.
   - It then checks if there is any existing password data in local storage.
   - If there is no existing data, it creates a JSON array with the new password entry and stores it in local storage.
   - If there is existing data, it retrieves the data, appends the new password entry, and updates the local storage.
   - An alert is displayed to indicate that the password has been saved, and the `showPasswords` function is called to refresh the displayed passwords in the table.

6. `Initialization` :
   - The code includes a `console.log` statement to indicate that it is working.
   - It also calls the `showPasswords` function to initialize and display any existing passwords when the page is loaded.
   - Lastly, it sets up an event listener for the button with the class "btn" to handle password submission.

This code provides a basic front-end interface for managing passwords, allowing users to add, view, and delete password entries while providing feedback on the actions taken. However, it should be noted that this code snippet is intended for educational purposes and may require further development and security enhancements for use in a production environment. Additionally, it relies on local storage for data storage, which may not be suitable for storing sensitive information due to security considerations.
